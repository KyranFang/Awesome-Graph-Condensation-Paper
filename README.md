# Awesome-Graph-Condensation-Paper

## Introduction

The swift expansion of graph data presents considerable difficulties in terms of storage, transfer, and especially in the training of graph neural networks (GNNs). In response to these challenges, graph condensation (GC) has become a novel approach. GC aims to create a smaller but highly representative graph, allowing GNNs trained on this reduced graph to attain results that are on par with those trained on the original, larger graph. Although vanilla Graph Condensation has achieved very good results on some datasets, there are still some issues such as generalization, scalability, robustness, efficiency, and fairness. A variety of methods have already been proposed to address these existing problems. Therefore, we summarize the existing methods and organize them into this paper list.
